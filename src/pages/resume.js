            <div className={"theProcess"}>
                <p>It all begins with the design. I begin by plotting the design of the website in excruciating detail using design software
                    such as Adobe XD and Adobe Illustrator. For inspiration, I typically view award winning websites of a similar nature to that
                    which I am designing. Emulating such sites results in beautiful designs such as the website which you are currently viewing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I have created a detailed mock-up, I decide what technologies I'll need in order to create the site. If I need an 
                    API of some sort, I will create that first, using the Express framework with Node.js to build a RESTful API to do whatever I need.
                    The beauty of Express is its incredible versatility, so if I need to change or add something later in the project, I can do so without worry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I have decided what technologies will be used to build the front-end, I start coding the website, page by page, while viewing the mock-up
                    and copying it. During this process, I play around with animations to make the site look more lively, potentially using animation libraries such
                    as React-Spring to my advantage. Additionally, I use a typical Agile method of coding and constant testing, so as to catch errors immediately. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I will launch the site on a remote server to test for errors that might not appear on machine and fix them accordingly. After this, I have completed my project.
